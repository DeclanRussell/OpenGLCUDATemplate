File \hyperlink{_text_8h}{Text.h} ]support unicode A\-S\-C\-I\-I is so 1980's ;-\/0 This class will generate billboard textures and Vertex\-Array\-Objects for each of the font glyphs, this means we need a valid Open\-G\-L context before using this class, therefore it should be constructed in initalize\-G\-L or after. Note for efficiency once the font has been created we can only change the colour, if you need different sizes / emphasis you will need to create a new \hyperlink{class_text}{Text} object with the desired size / emphasis. This is accelerated as much as possible but text rendering will sometimes be slow as we bind a new texture for each char being drawn for more details look at the blog post here \href{http://jonmacey.blogspot.com/2011/10/text-rendering-using-opengl-32.html}{\tt http\-://jonmacey.\-blogspot.\-com/2011/10/text-\/rendering-\/using-\/opengl-\/32.\-html}
